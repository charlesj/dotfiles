This repository contains my automated setup for my workstation and homelab infrastructure.  It is always a work in progress.

*Note*: These roles and playbooks are targeting Ubuntu, and may not work on other distributions.  They definitely will not work without the ansible vault password, but the number of things that are encrypted are low.  I have only encrypted sensitive data.


I could not do this work without access to the work of others.  Many thanks to the following people / repos for helping me set this up:

- https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/ubuntu-ansible
- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles
- https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles
